# Advantages
# 1. It describes what the number 2200 represents - the maximum post length
# 2. If the maximum post length changes, we just need to change the variable in one place - compare to the previous
#    version where we would have to make the change in two places. That doesn't sound like a lot,
#    but some data might be used in lots of different places and if you have to make changes everywhere, that's
#    a lot of work and it's easy to miss one by mistake and now you have a bug in your program.
